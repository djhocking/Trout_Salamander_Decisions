# Trout_Salamander_Decisions
Salamander Expert Elicitation, Trout-Salamander Interactions Climate Model, Trout-Salamander Decision Analysis

1. Expert elicitation for salamanders
2. Trout-Salamander co-occurrence forecast model with uncertainty
3. Land-protection optimization decision model (upland vs. buffer, local vs. upstream) 

I currently have all three parts of the project in one repository. I think it will be fine having multiple R Projects in different subfolders but if this causes a problem we can break this into 3 separate git repos.
