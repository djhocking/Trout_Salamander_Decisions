# Trout_Salamander_Decisions
Salamander Expert Elicitation, Trout-Salamander Interactions Climate Model, Trout-Salamander Decision Analysis

1. Expert elicitation for multiple stream-salamanders (Lead: Katz)
   Milestone: salamander-elicitation (for setting timeline and tasks)
   Elicit parmaeter values and model beleifs from 20+ experts.
   Identify concensus and disagreement among experts.
   Predict species-specific salamander occupancy/distribution across NE/salamander ranges and compare to exisiting maps/models.
   Sensitivity analysis for each salamander species.

2. Trout-Salamander co-occurrence with uncertainty (Lead: Hocking)
   Milestone: co-occurrence  (for setting timeline and tasks)
   Forecast co-occurrence and propogate climate, structural, and parameter uncertainty in both fish and salamanader models.
   100 randomly selected subwatersheds across the NE
   Sensitivity analysis of both fish and salamanders.

3. Land-protection optimization decision model for fish and salamanders (Leads: Katz and Hocking)
   Evaluate optimal land protection strategies for co-occurrance under uncertainty (reduce complexity of co-occurrence model)
   Protection from forest loss (purchasing land within 30-m riparian or upland)
   Two hypotheses: protecting upland is better, protecting near-stream is better
   100 randomly selected subwatersheds across the NE
  
Currently, have all three parts of the project in one repository. It should be fine having multiple R Projects in different subfolders, but if this causes a problem we can break this into 3 separate git repos.
